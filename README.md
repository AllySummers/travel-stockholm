Website built from scratch in HTML &amp; CSS to "advertise" travelling to a remote location

Made as part of a year 12 web design assignment to advertise to the general public travelling to a remote location. It uses basic JavasScript for some small functions (as required by assignment) and also has all HTML and CSS written from scratch. There was no requirement to create a responsive version of this site in the rubric.
